## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Launch Simplified Bot (Default)**
```bash
# Production mode with ~$300 capital
python entry_points/run_bot.py --mode production --capital 1.5

# Simulation mode for testing
python entry_points/run_bot.py --mode simulation --capital 10.0
```

### **Configuration**
The simplified bot uses lean, hardcoded parameters for reliability:
