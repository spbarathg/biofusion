# AntBot Security Audit

## Executive Summary

This security audit evaluates the AntBot trading system, focusing on wallet encryption, secret management, and CI/CD security. The audit identifies several risks and provides recommendations for remediation before production deployment.

## Scope

- Wallet encryption and key management
- Secret management and storage
- CI/CD pipeline security
- Access control mechanisms
- Backup security

## Findings

### High Severity

1. **Plaintext Encryption Keys in Configuration Files** 
   - **Issue**: The encryption key is stored in a plaintext file at `DATA_DIR / ".encryption_key"`
   - **Risk**: If server is compromised, all wallet data can be decrypted
   - **Recommendation**: Move encryption keys to a secure key management solution like HashiCorp Vault or AWS KMS

2. **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - **Issue**: No MFA for admin operations like wallet creation or colony management
   - **Risk**: Single compromised credential can lead to full system access
   - **Recommendation**: Implement MFA for all privileged operations

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Secrets Exposure**
   - **Issue**: GitHub repository secrets may be exposed in logs or to pull request authors
   - **Risk**: Pipeline credentials could be leaked
   - **Recommendation**: Implement proper secret scoping, use OIDC token authentication where possible

### Medium Severity

1. **Insufficient Key Rotation Procedures**
   - **Issue**: No automated key rotation mechanism for encryption keys
   - **Risk**: Old keys remain in use indefinitely, increasing exposure risk
   - **Recommendation**: Implement automated key rotation with re-encryption of existing data

2. **Weak Password Policy for Dashboard**
   - **Issue**: No password complexity requirements or expiration policy
   - **Risk**: Weak passwords could lead to unauthorized access
   - **Recommendation**: Enforce strong password policy with regular rotation

3. **Backup Encryption Uses Same Key as Data**
   - **Issue**: Backups are encrypted with the same key used for live data
   - **Risk**: Compromise of one key affects both live and backup data
   - **Recommendation**: Use separate encryption keys for backups

4. **Limited Audit Logging**
   - **Issue**: Insufficient logging of security-relevant events
   - **Risk**: Security incidents may not be detected or properly investigated
   - **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive audit logging with integrity protection

### Low Severity

1. **Default Configuration Values**
   - **Issue**: Some security-relevant settings have default values
   - **Risk**: Insecure defaults might be used in production
   - **Recommendation**: Force explicit configuration of all security settings

2. **Docker Image Uses Root User**
   - **Issue**: Some Docker containers may run as root
   - **Risk**: Container escape could gain root access to host
   - **Recommendation**: Ensure all containers run as non-root user

3. **Static Code Analysis Gaps**
   - **Issue**: No dependency scanning or SAST in CI/CD pipeline
   - **Risk**: Known vulnerabilities in dependencies may go undetected
   - **Recommendation**: Add dependency scanning and SAST tools to pipeline

## CI/CD Security Recommendations

1. **Secret Scanning**:
   - Add a secret scanning tool like GitGuardian or GitHub Secret Scanning
   - Scan for accidental commits of keys, tokens, or credentials

2. **Dependency Scanning**:
   - Add dependency scanning with tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk
   - Add GitHub Dependabot for automated dependency updates

3. **Static Code Analysis**:
   - Implement Python static code analysis with Bandit
   - Implement Rust static code analysis with Cargo-audit

4. **Container Scanning**:
   - Scan container images for vulnerabilities with Trivy or Clair
   - Implement least privilege principle in container definitions

5. **Build Artifact Signing**:
   - Implement signing of Docker images and release artifacts
   - Verify signatures before deployment

## Key Rotation Implementation

1. **Key Rotation Process**:
   - Generate new encryption key
   - Decrypt data with old key, re-encrypt with new key
   - Update key storage
   - Securely delete old key

2. **Automated Rotation Schedule**:
   - Implement 90-day rotation schedule for encryption keys
   - Maintain key history for backup recovery
   - Implement emergency rotation procedure for compromised keys
