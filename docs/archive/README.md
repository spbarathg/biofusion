# ARCHIVED DOCUMENTATION

This directory contains **historical documentation** from Antbot's architectural evolution.

## Archived Documents

### `ANTBOT_REFACTORING_PLAN.md`
- **Purpose**: Strategic plan for transitioning from complex multi-agent system to lean mathematical core
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All objectives achieved
- **Historical Value**: Documents the architectural decision-making process and rationale

### `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`  
- **Purpose**: After-action report documenting refactoring results
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - System successfully transformed
- **Historical Value**: Quantifies improvements achieved (2,300+ lines eliminated, performance gains)

## Why Archived?

These documents served their purpose during the architectural transformation but are no longer needed for day-to-day development:

- **Mission Completed**: The refactoring objectives have been fully achieved
- **Avoid Confusion**: Prevents new developers from thinking refactoring is still in progress  
- **Historical Reference**: Preserved for understanding architectural evolution

## Current Documentation

For current system information, see:
- **`/README.md`** - What the system is and how to run it
- **`/CONTRIBUTING.md`** - How to build and maintain the system
- **`/docs/validation/`** - Development and testing tools

*The lean mathematical core is now the established architecture. These documents represent the successful journey to that destination.*
