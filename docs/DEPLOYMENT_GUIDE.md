## 🔧 CONFIGURATION CUSTOMIZATION

### **More Conservative** (Lower Risk)
```bash
# Edit .env.production
MAX_POSITION_SIZE_PERCENT=25.0    # Reduce from 35%
STOP_LOSS_PERCENT=3.0             # Widen from 2%

python check_balance.py
# Fund wallet with more SOL
```

#### "RPC Connection Failed"  
```bash
# Switch to backup RPC
python switch_rpc.py --backup
# Check network status
```

#### "No Trading Opportunities"
```bash
# Lower confidence threshold
sed -i 's/ML_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.55/ML_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.50/' .env.production
# Restart system
```
